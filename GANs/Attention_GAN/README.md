# Attention GANs

This GitHub repository contains the results, emulated code (using pre-trained networks), presentation slides, and report for our Computer Vision Final Project, where we explored and implemented the "Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Attention-guided Generative Adversarial Network" by Hao Tang, Hong Liu, Dan Xu, Philip H.S. Torr, and Nicu Sebe.
