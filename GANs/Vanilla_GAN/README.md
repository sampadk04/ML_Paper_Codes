# Vanilla GAN
A Vanilla GAN consists of two neural networks, a Generator and a Discriminator, which compete against each other in a zero-sum game. The Generator creates fake data samples, while the Discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and fake samples. The goal is to improve both networks through adversarial training until the Generator produces realistic data.
